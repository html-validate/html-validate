# html-validate changelog

## Upcoming release

### Features

- bump dependencies.
- use `acorn-walk` instead of `acorn@5`.

## 0.14.1 (2018-11-04)

### Bugfixes

- fix dependency on `acorn`, the package now properly resolves acorn 5 when
  dependant pulls acorn 6.

## 0.14.0 (2018-11-03)

- support global metadata.
- new rule `attribute-allowed-values` validates allowed values for attributes,
  such as `type` for `<input>`.

## 0.13.0 (2018-10-21)

### Features

- `deprecated` supports adding a message for custom elements.
- Rule constructors can now throw exceptions. Previously the exceptions would be
  silently swallowed and the rule would trigger the missing rule logic.
- Support writing element metadata inline in configuration file.

### Bugfixes

- `element-permitted-order` now reports the error where the malplaced element is
  instead of the parent element (which holds the restriction). Fixes #10.

## 0.12.0 (2018-10-17)

### Features

- Support writing plugins with custom rules.
- Bump dependencies, including typescript 3.0 to 3.1

## 0.11.1 (2018-10-07)

### Features

- Rule documentation examples are now validated automatically with htmlvalidate
  to provide direct feedback of how a rule will react on the given markup.

## 0.11.0 (2018-09-23)

### Breaking changes

  `off`. The old name will continue to work but will be removed in the future.

  single error.
- rules are now using dynamic severity which can change at runtime.
- new class `Attribute` used by `DOMNode`. Attributes now holds the location

  only subsequent usages.
