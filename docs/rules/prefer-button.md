# Prefer to use `<button>` (`prefer-button`)

HTML5 introduces the generic `<button>` element which replaces `<input type="button">` and similar constructs.

The `<button>` elements has some advantages:

- It can contain markup as content compared to the `value` attribute of `<input>` which can only hold text. Especially useful to add `<svg>` icons.
- The button text is a regular text node, no need to quote characters in the `value` attribute.
- Styling is easier, compare the selector `button` to `input[type="submit"], input[type="button"], ...`.

This rule will target the following input types:

- `<input type="button">`
- `<input type="submit">`
- `<input type="reset">`
- `<input type="image">`
