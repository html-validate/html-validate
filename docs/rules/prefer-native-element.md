# Prefer to use native HTML element over roles (`prefer-native-element`)

While WAI-ARIA describes many [roles][wai-aria-roles] which can provide semantic information about what the element represents.
Support for roles is varying and since HTML5 has many native equivalent elements it is better to use the native when possible.

Table of equivalent elements:
