# Require CSP nonce for resources (`require-csp-nonce`)

Requires that a [Content-Security-Policy (CSP)][mdn-csp] nonce is present on elements required by the policy.

The CSP nonce is a cryptography secure random token and must match the `Content-Security-Policy` header for the given resource.
The token should be unique per request and should not be guessable by an attacker.
It is used to prevent cross site scripting (XSS) by preventing malicious actors from injecting scripts into the page.

> `Content-Security-Policy: script-src 'nonce-r4nd0m'`

Given the above header all inline `<script>` elements must contain the `nonce="r4nd0m"` attribute (see examples below).

If you dont use nonces or CSP you should not use this rule.
