## Features

- **Fragments**: can test fragments of HTML, for instance a component template.
- **Local**: does not upload any data to a remote server, all testing is done
  locally.
- **Strict**: strict and non-forgiving parsing. It will not try to correct any
  incorrect markup or guess what it should do.
- **Content model**: understands HTML content model so complex validation can be
  done.
- **Extendable**: easily write your own rules and/or element metadata.
