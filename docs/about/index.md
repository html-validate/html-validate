# About

HTML-validate was created by David Sveningsson in early 2016 with a few goals in mind:

- Enterprise and privacy friendly: no data should leave the machine.
- Pluggable and extendable: must be easy to extend with own domain-specific
  functionallity and rules.
- Strict and non-forgiving: should never try to autocorrect or guess anything.
- First-class support for views, components and templates, including when using
  javascript frameworks.
