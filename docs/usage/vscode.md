# VS Code Extension

To get validation directly in VS Code use the [HTML-Validate extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=html-validate.vscode-html-validate):

    ext install html-validate.vscode-html-validate

The extension is also available on the [Open VSX Registry](https://open-vsx.org): [HTML-Validate](https://open-vsx.org/extension/html-validate/vscode-html-validate)
