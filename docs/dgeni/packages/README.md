The packages here is forked from the now seemingly unmaintained [dgeni-packages](https://github.com/angular/dgeni-packages) package.

- Last commit was 2022
- Many of the last commits is done by me.
- Unmerged pull requests and no activity on issues.
- Outdated dependencies (including high vulernabilities)

Differences from upstream:

- Stripped of everything not strictly needed by this repository.
- Some dependencies dropped in favor of native replacements or similar functions.
- Up-to-date dependencies.
- Cosmetic: reformatted and linted with the style enforced by this repository.
